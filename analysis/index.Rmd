# Overview

In this analysis, we study a dataset of **TODO:** 1-2 paragraphs describing dataset.

After sequencing, expression was quantified by counting the number of UMIs mapped to each gene using `r Biocpkg("scPipe")`[@tian2018scpipe].
Count data for all endogeneous genes (GENCODE Release 28 (GRCh38.p12)) and spike-in transcripts (ERCC) are available in this repository.

This analysis is adapted from the [**Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor book**](https://osca.bioconductor.org).
